# Cat-Recognition

### Before you start
Run this following command for installing libraries.
After you need to run in release, because without release 
you will wait about 30-40 minutes to train neural network

```cargo run --release```

Also, if you want, you can make release build significantly smaller than before.

```cargo bloat --release --crates```
